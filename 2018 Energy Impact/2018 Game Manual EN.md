# **Introduction**

## **FIRST Global**

*FIRST* Global organizes a yearly international robotics challenge to ignite a passion for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) among the more than two billion youths across the world. By bringing these future STEM leaders together in an engaging and collaborative competition that drives home the importance, excitement, and applicability of STEM education, *FIRST* Global inspires students to learn the skills they will need to make the discoveries their parents and grandparents would consider miracles, impossibilities, or just plain science fiction.

 

*FIRST* Global also strives to convince the various national governments and organizations of the world to embrace STEM education, and to support it by investing in their young adults that will soon begin to make their marks in the world.

 

Themed around the[ ](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx)[14 Grand Challenges of Engineering](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx) identified by National Academy of Engineering, each year a different Grand Challenge takes center stage in an effort to foster understanding and cooperation among the youth of the world as they use their abilities to solve the world’s problems.

 

Participation in *FIRST* Global is about so much more than just robots. As participants learn to find solutions to the world’s grand challenges – water, energy, security, medicine, food, and education – they learn how to work with each other, trust each other, and become part of a truly global community.

 

More information about the *FIRST* Global program, including contact information and links to social media information, can be found at the[ ](https://first.global/)[FIRST Global](https://first.global/) website.

 

REV Robotics supplies the Kit of Parts that teams will use to build their robots. Spare or replacement parts, as well as additional information about the parts contained in the kit, can be found on the[ ](https://www.revrobotics.com/first-global/)[REV Robotics](https://www.revrobotics.com/first-global/) website.

 

## **Energy Impact** 

In *Energy Impact,* teams learn about real-world energy challenges surrounding electrical grid connectivity and the role of diverse sources of energy.  Teams will be organized into two alliances comprising of three national teams per alliance that are randomized every game.

 

*Energy Impact* is played on a 6m by 7m field where each alliance of national teams works together to connect and power their respective villages using multiple energy generation sources.

 

For complete details and specific game-play rules see “The Game”, starting on page 3.

## **This Document and Its Conventions**

These rules are explicit. Avoid interpreting rules based on last year’s rules, assumptions about intent or how a situation would work in “real life.” All teams are expected to abide by the *FIRST* Global Competition rules as they are written and must follow the intent of the rule.

 

Key words which have a specific definition in *Energy Impact* are indicated in ALL CAPS.

 

This rules manual is originally written in English but may be translated into other languages to improve the ease of access and understanding for teams.  In the case of apparent conflicting meanings between a translated version and the English language version, the English version published on the FIRST Global website will be considered the correct version.

 

There will be a [dedicated Question and Answer (Q&A) page](https://first.global/fgc/game-qa/) where teams may ask clarifying questions about game and robot rules. Answers from the Q&A are considered official clarification of rules, and teams are encouraged to periodically check this system.

 

Any necessary updates to this game manual will be made through[ ](https://first.global/)[FIRST.global](https://first.global/). When updates are released, that information will be publicized in as many locations as possible, but teams should visit the [FIRST Global Game page](https://first.global/fgc/game/) periodically to ensure that they are aware of any changes.

 

Blue Box comments detail warnings, cautions, and notes for that rule. Pay close attention to their content as they provide insight into the reasoning behind a rule and other helpful information.

 

# **The Game**

## **Game Description**

 

Matches are played on a 6m by 7m field set up as shown in Figures 1-1, 1-2, and 1-3. Two (2) VILLAGE alliances -- one (1) Red and one (1) Blue -- composed of three (3) national teams compete in each MATCH. The objective of *Energy Impact* is to generate more power than the opposing VILLAGE. VILLAGES must CONNECT POWER LINES from POWER GENERATORS to the VILLAGE POWER STATION. Once CONNECTED, POWER GENERATORS require the completion of specific tasks before they begin to generate power for the VILLAGE. Tasks include supplying FUEL CUBES to the connected REACTION PLANT and connected COMBUSTION PLANT, starting a WIND TURBINE, and installing SOLAR PANELS in the SOLAR ARRAY.

 

VILLAGES which make their grid more robust with a Vehicle-to-Grid by having all three robots PARKED at the VILLAGE POWER STATION at the end of the MATCH will receive an additional bonus.

 

VILLAGES that work together to connect the COOPERTITION POWER LINE between both VILLAGE POWER STATIONS also receive a bonus.

**![img]((ENGLISH)%202018%20FIRST%20Global%20Challenge_%20Energy%20Impact%20Game%20Manual(1_files/image010.jpg)**

**Figure 1-3: View of entire field**

 

*Energy Impact* is played on a raised 6m by 7m carpeted field, bounded by and including the inward facing surfaces of the GUARDRAILS, VILLAGE POWER STATION, and COMBUSTION PLANT.

 

The carpet (Select Elements Home and Office Cobblestone, Heather Green) is a low pile carpet similar to those found in many public or commercial buildings. Any low pile carpet may be used for practice, and will react in a similar way for both game elements and robot driving.

 

On each short side of the field, the VILLAGE DRIVER STATIONS are where the teams’ drivers and coaches stand during the MATCH. Also on the short side of the field is the SOLAR PANEL FACTORY where up to two (2) HUMAN PLAYERS can stand.

 

At the back corners, there are the red and blue alliance VILLAGE POWER STATIONS where up to two (2) HUMAN PLAYERS from that alliance can stand.

 

Each alliance only has three (3) HUMAN PLAYERS, so the alliances will need to decide where these players should stand for the entire match. After the match begins they cannot change locations (**G04**).

 

At the center of the field, there is a REACTION PLANT, shared between the two VILLAGES, in which eight (8) FUEL CUBES must be scored before the plant will generate power.

 

Each VILLAGE also has a dedicated fuel COMBUSTION PLANT where FUEL CUBES are deposited for a fixed kiloJoule (kJ) award per cube.

 

Each VILLAGE also has a dedicated WIND TURBINE which is activated by a robot turning the starter crank.   

 

There are forty eight (48) FUEL CUBES that begin on the field of play. These are located within the starting area, which is between the two villages in the area between the REACTION PLANT and the front guard rail. Cubes are randomly placed within this area with no exact orientation or starting location. The cubes are made of reinforced cardboard and nominally have 15 cm sides.

 

## **Game Definitions**

 

**MATCH:** Two (2) minutes and thirty (30) seconds of gameplay where the DRIVE TEAM controls their ROBOT on the PLAYING FIELD to generate as much power as possible. The MATCH begins when the scoreboard timer starts to count down and finishes when the timer reaches zero (0:00) time remaining.

 

**ROBOT:** Any single mechanism that has passed inspection and a DRIVE TEAM places on the PLAYING FIELD prior to the start of a MATCH.

 

**ENTANGLEMENT:** When two ROBOTS become interconnected on the field during the course of the MATCH.

 

**CONTROL:** An object is considered to be CONTROLLED by a ROBOT if the object is following the movement of the ROBOT. In general, for an object to be considered CONTROLLED, there must be a strategic advantage to the movement as judged by the Head Referee.

 

For example, pushing multiple FUEL CUBES towards a goal would be considered CONTROLLING the cubes. Pushing multiple FUEL CUBES in an attempt to separate out individual cubes is not considered CONTROL unless there is an attempt to move the cubes in an advantageous direction.

 

**DRIVE TEAM** The up to four (4) STUDENTS from a team who fulfill the roles of DRIVER(s), HUMAN PLAYER, and/or CAPTAIN for a given match.

 

**STUDENT:**  Person 18 years old or younger, enrolled in a pre-university school.

 

**CAPTAIN:** A STUDENT from a team who is in the VILLAGE DRIVER STATION during the MATCH. The CAPTAIN’S job is to watch the whole field, advise the DRIVER(s) and HUMAN PLAYER(s), and provide match strategy. Each team may contain one (1) CAPTAIN.

 

The Captain’s primary responsibility is to monitor match play and guide their DRIVERS and HUMAN PLAYERS. The captain also coordinates strategy with other alliance members. There is no explicit rule that the captain cannot hold or touch the controls.

 

**DRIVER:** A STUDENT from a team which operates the team’s robot during the MATCH while standing in the VILLAGE DRIVER STATION. Each team must contain at least one (1) DRIVER, but can include up to two (2) DRIVERS if desired.

 

**HUMAN PLAYER:** A STUDENT member of the team that interacts with CUBES and SOLAR PANELS during the MATCH. The HUMAN PLAYER stands in either the VILLAGE POWER STATION or the SOLAR PANEL FACTORY.  Once the MATCH starts, the HUMAN PLAYER cannot change locations. Each team must contain only one (1) HUMAN PLAYER.

 

**VILLAGE:** Also referred to as the alliance. A pre-assigned alliance of three (3) national teams that work together for a given MATCH.

 

**PLAYING FIELD:** A raised 6m by 7m carpeted area, bounded by and including the inward facing surfaces of the GUARDRAILS and COMBUSTION PLANT, where VILLAGES control their ROBOTS. Within the VILLAGE POWER STATION, the edge of the PLAYING FIELD is considered to be the raised back edge of the ramp leading into the HUMAN PLAYER portion of the VILLAGE POWER STATION. Other structures within the boundaries (WIND TURBINE and/or REACTION PLANT) are considered part of the PLAYING FIELD. Game pieces (FUEL CUBES, POWER LINE CUBES, and/or SOLAR PANELS) are considered part of the PLAYING FIELD if any portion of the game piece is within the boundary of the PLAYING FIELD.

 

**GUARDRAILS:** A system of clear polycarbonate 20cm tall borders surrounding the PLAYING FIELD perimeter to prevent robots from inadvertently leaving the PLAYING FIELD.

 

**VILLAGE DRIVER STATION:** The area along the short ends of the field where alliances stand to control their robots. Each team may have up to 3 STUDENTS in the VILLAGE DRIVER STATION during a MATCH.

 

**VILLAGE POWER STATION:** The HUMAN PLAYER area on the two back corners of the field adjacent to the VILLAGE DRIVER STATION. On the side adjacent to the field, there are openings at the bottom for robots to exchange items with the HUMAN PLAYERS. See drawings for specific dimensions.

 

**PARKED:** A ROBOT is considered PARKED if it is completely supported by the ramp on the front of their VILLAGE POWER STATION and no part of the ROBOT is touching the playing field carpet. 

 

**POWER GENERATORS:** The general name for the four (4) field elements which are used to produce power for a VILLAGE. POWER GENERATORS consist of the following elements:

●      COMBUSTION PLANT

●      REACTION PLANT

●      WIND TURBINE

●      SOLAR PANEL(S)     

 

**COMBUSTION PLANT:** One (1) of four (4) POWER GENERATORS. Each VILLAGE has their own dedicated COMBUSTION PLANT. The COMBUSTION PLANT has two scoring locations, one low goal and one upper goal. The low goal is approximately 25cm high by 45cm wide and located at the playing surface level. The upper goal is raised approximately 60 cm off the playing surface and measures 25cm by 25cm. Both goal openings are centered between the left and right edges of the COMBUSTION PLANT.  See drawings for specific dimensions, and see “Game Rules: Scoring” for specific information about how this POWER GENERATOR produces power.

 

**REACTION PLANT:** One (1) of four (4) POWER GENERATORS. Both VILLAGES share one (1) REACTION PLANT, located along the centerline of the field, with goal openings facing the DRIVER STATIONS. It has eight (8) FUEL CUBE scoring spaces measuring approximately 25cm by 25cm, four (4) along the ground and four (4) elevated approximately 47.5cm off the ground.  See drawings for specific dimensions, and see “Game Rules: Scoring” for specific information about how this POWER GENERATOR produces power.

 

**WIND TURBINE:** One (1) of four (4) POWER GENERATORS. The WIND TURBINE is activated by a ROBOT spinning the starter crank, which is a fork shaped protrusion about 30 cm off the ground near the base of the WIND TURBINE. See drawings for specific dimensions and see “Game Rules: Scoring” for specific information about how this POWER GENERATOR produces power.

 

**SOLAR PANEL:** One (1) of four (4) POWER GENERATORS. The SOLAR PANELS are color-coded and may only be used by the matching VILLAGE ALLIANCE and ROBOT. A 15cm by 25cm square of REV extrusion with graphics on the plane parallel to the frame. The panel weighs approximately 200g. Ten (10) SOLAR PANELS are located in the SOLAR PANEL FACTORY at the start of the MATCH and are introduced into play within the LOADING ZONE by a HUMAN PLAYER located within the SOLAR PANEL FACTORY. See drawings for specific dimensions and see “Game Rules: Scoring” for specific information about how this POWER GENERATOR produces power.

 

**SOLAR ARRAY:** Areas where the SOLAR PANELS are INSTALLED by a HUMAN PLAYER within the VILLAGE POWER STATION. There are five (5) scoring locations in the SOLAR ARRAY where SOLAR PANELS must be INSTALLED before they will begin to produce power.

 

**INSTALLED:** A SOLAR PANEL is considered INSTALLED when it has been delivered to the VILLAGE POWER STATION by a ROBOT and a HUMAN PLAYER has placed it into the SOLAR ARRAY in the VILLAGE POWER STATION.

 

**SOLAR PANEL FACTORY:** The HUMAN PLAYER area on each team’s half of the field which contains ten (10) SOLAR PANELS and two (2) POWER LINE CUBES. This area is designated for the HUMAN PLAYER to place SOLAR PANELS and POWER LINE CUBES into the LOADING ZONE for ROBOT retrieval.

 

**LOADING ZONE:** The area contained by the taped-off triangle on the PLAYING FIELD surface and the GUARDRAIL in front of the SOLAR PANEL FACTORY. This area is technically part of the PLAYING FIELD but is meant to HUMAN PLAYERS to place SOLAR PANELS and POWER LINE CUBES for ROBOT retrieval. HUMAN PLAYERS should pay close attention to **E11** and **E05** when interacting with the LOADING ZONE.  

 

**FUEL CUBE:** A white, approximately 15cm reinforced cardboard cube weighing approximately 105g. FUEL CUBES can be delivered by a ROBOT to the COMBUSTION PLANT or REACTION PLANT to generate power. A ROBOT may CONTROL up to three (3) total cubes (either FUEL CUBE or POWER LINE CUBE) at a time, of which only one (1) cube can be a POWER LINE CUBE. Teams should review **E06** for additional information about CONTROL of cubes.

 

**SCORING A FUEL CUBE:** A FUEL CUBE is SCORED when any part of the FUEL CUBE breaks the plane of the front of a COMBUSTION or REACTION PLANT goal and the cube is fully supported by the goal. FUEL CUBES which are completely removed such that no part of the FUEL CUBE is breaking the front plane of either plant will not be considered to be SCORED.

 

**POWER LINE CUBE:** A VILLAGE-colored approximately 15cm reinforced cardboard cube weighing approximately 105g.. These cubes are located at specific locations on the PLAYING FIELD, as well as two (2) in the SOLAR PANEL FACTORY. POWER LINE CUBES are used to CONNECT POWER LINES and the COOPERTITION POWER LINE. Each ROBOT is allowed to CONTROL no more than one (1) POWER LINE CUBE of their alliance’s color at one time. If CONTROLLING one (1) POWER LINE CUBE, the ROBOT can only CONTROL up to two (2) additional FUEL CUBES. Teams should review **E06** and **E07** for additional information about CONTROL of cubes.

 

**POWER LINE:** 15mm reinforced color LED strip mounted between each VILLAGE POWER STATION and its POWER GENERATORS. During the MATCH, the color of the lights indicate if the POWER LINE is CONNECTED and if the POWER GENERATOR is producing power. POWER LINE CUBES of the alliance’s color must be delivered to the alliance’s VILLAGE POWER STATION by a robot of the same alliance color as the cube and placed in a corresponding location by a HUMAN PLAYER to connect a POWER LINE between the VILLAGE POWER STATION and a POWER GENERATOR.

 

**COOPERTITION POWER LINE:** 15mm reinforced color LED strip mounted between the two opposing VILLAGE POWER STATIONS. This special power line will earn each VILLAGE a bonus if connected, but in order to CONNECT this line, two (2) POWER LINE CUBES must be placed, with one (1) cube in each VILLAGE POWER STATION. The cube placed by an alliance must be of the opposing alliance’s color. Since alliances cannot control their opposing alliance’s POWER LINE CUBES, and both cubes must be placed before the bonus is earned, CONNECTION of this line will require the cooperation of both VILLAGES. During the MATCH, the color of the lights indicate if the COOPERTITION POWER LINE is CONNECTED.

 

**YELLOW CARD:** An official penalty assessed to a DRIVE TEAM for breaking a rule. YELLOW CARDS given to teams during a MATCH will come with a 30 kJ penalty, which will be awarded to the opposing alliance. Additional YELLOW CARDS may be elevated to a RED CARD at the judgement of the Head Referee, depending on the severity and frequency of infraction.

 

**RED CARD:** An official penalty assessed to a DRIVE TEAM for repeatedly breaking a rule, breaking multiple rules, or egregious actions.  Generally a YELLOW CARD is given before a RED CARD, but it is at the Head Referee’s discretion to issue a RED CARD based on the severity of the infraction. When a team receives a RED CARD they will receive no points for that specific MATCH.

 

 

## **Game Rules**

## Scoring

 

**Solar Panel**

ROBOTS retrieve SOLAR PANELS from a slot on the wall within the LOADING ZONE or from the surface of the PLAYING FIELD. The HUMAN PLAYER in the SOLAR PANEL FACTORY can place a SOLAR PANEL in the panel pick-up slot or on the PLAYING FIELD surface for ROBOT retrieval, with the understanding that **E11** and **E05** are to be carefully followed. The ROBOT can transport the SOLAR PANEL to the VILLAGE POWER STATION where a human player can retrieve it and INSTALL it in the SOLAR ARRAY. Once INSTALLED, each panel will produce one (1) kJ per second for the remainder of the game.

 

**Wind Turbine**

To generate power for the VILLAGE, the WIND TURBINE must be CONNECTED to the VILLAGE POWER STATION with a POWER LINE and must have been started by a ROBOT using the starter crank. To start the WIND TURBINE, the ROBOT needs to spin the starter crank at the base of their alliance’s windmill. Once the crank rotates three (3) full revolutions, the WIND TURBINE will begin spinning to indicate that it has started to produce power. After the WIND TURBINE has been started and CONNECTED with a POWER LINE, it will produce one (1) kJ per second for the remainder of the game.

 

**Reaction Plant**

To generate power for the VILLAGE, the REACTION PLANT must be CONNECTED to the VILLAGE POWER STATION with a POWER LINE and must have been fully fueled by SCORING a FUEL CUBE in each of the eight (8) scoring slots. After the REACTION PLANT has been fully fueled and CONNECTED with a POWER LINE, it will produce three (3) kJ per second for the remainder of the game.

 

**Combustion Plant**

To generate power for the VILLAGE, the COMBUSTION PLANT must be CONNECTED to the VILLAGE POWER STATION with a POWER LINE, and FUEL CUBEs must be SCORED in either the upper or lower goals. Robots can use the lower goal to gain five (5) kJ per SCORED FUEL CUBE, or the upper goal to gain 20 kJ per SCORED FUEL CUBE. FUEL CUBES scored in the COMBUSTION PLANT will not be returned to the PLAYING FIELD during a MATCH. FUEL CUBES SCORED in the COMBUSTION PLANT before the POWER LINE is CONNECTED will count towards a team’s overall kJ if the POWER LINE is CONNECTED before the end of the MATCH.

 

**Coopertition** **Bonus**

VILLAGE ALLIANCES can work to link their two village grids together using the COOPERTITION POWER LINE to earn an additional bonus for both alliances. To CONNECT the COOPERTITION POWER LINE, one POWER LINE CUBE from each alliance must be delivered by a ROBOT to the opposite alliance VILLAGE POWER STATION and placed by a HUMAN PLAYER in the appropriate power line slot. Since alliances cannot CONTROL their opposing alliance’s POWER LINE CUBES, and both cubes must be placed before the bonus is earned, CONNECTION of this line will require the cooperation of both VILLAGES. Completion of this task will earn each VILLAGE an extra 100 kJ. 

 

**End Game**

As the game ends, robots race to park on the ramp of their VILLAGE POWER STATION so the battery packs in their robots can contribute to their electric grid. Each robot PARKED at the VILLAGE POWER STATION when the game has ended adds 15 kJ per robot. If all three (3) ROBOTS belonging to one (1) VILLAGE are PARKED, an extra 5 kJ will be awarded, for a total bonus of 50 kJ.

## Safety Rules

 

**【S01】 ROBOTs must stay on the PLAYING FIELD.** If a ROBOT goes completely out of bounds or appears to have a high likelihood of violating **S02** due to actions outside of the PLAYING FIELD, it will be disabled by the Head Referee for the rest of the MATCH. This is not intended to penalize ROBOTs for having mechanisms which inadvertently and inconsequentially cross the GUARDRAIL by small amounts during normal game play.

*Violation Consequence: ROBOT Disabled for MATCH*

 

**【S02】** **ROBOTs must not be dangerous or damaging to the field, or humans around the field.** ROBOT or team actions should not damage the field or field elements or pose a safety risk to other team members or volunteers. If the Head Referee determines the team to be in violation of this rule, or that the team has a high likelihood of violating this rule, the ROBOT may be disabled for the match and must be re-inspected before taking the field again.

*Violation Consequence: ROBOT Disabled for MATCH*

 

Robots must not have sharp edges which could cut someone or damage the field. Teams should pay close attention when interacting with FUEL CUBES and other game elements. Large abrasions or holes in game or field elements are in violation of this rule.

 

## General Game Rules

 

**【G01】 Play the game as written.**  These rules are written as simply as possible to make them as accessible as possible, regardless of a team’s native language. Attempts to gain competitive advantage by employing an unintended method of play violates the rules and does not meet the spirit of *FIRST* Global.

1. Questions or clarification about the gameplay or rules should be submitted in the Q&A system
2. If there is an apparent conflict between a translated version of the rules and the original language version, the original language version (English) hosted on the FIRST.global website will be considered correct.
3. Any necessary updates to this game manual will be published on the FIRST.global website. If updates are released, the latest version of the game manual published on FIRST.global will be considered correct.

 

**【G02】 ROBOTs must start the match within a 50cm x 50cm x 50cm volume.** Before a MATCH can start, all ROBOTs on the PLAYING FIELD must meet this requirement. The team’s national flag or alliance indicator may exceed this volume constraint.

1. If the problem can be corrected quickly, the Head Referee will invite a team member from the offending robot to fix the situation.
2. If the problem cannot be corrected quickly, the offending robot will be removed from the PLAYING FIELD and the match will start without the offending robot.
3. Robots may extend beyond this size after the MATCH begins, but teams should pay attention to rules **G08** and **E09**.
4. Robots which expand cannot leave behind any parts. See **G07**.

 

**【G03】 Each drive team may consist of up to 4 students.** The maximum allowed drive team members are two (2) DRIVERS, one (1) CAPTAIN and one (1) HUMAN PLAYER. The minimum allowed drive team members are one (1) HUMAN PLAYER, who should show up for matches even if the robot is not functioning (See **T02**).  These are the only team members allowed at the field and to set up the robot. 

*Violation Consequence: Must be corrected before the MATCH can start.*

 

**【G04】 Remain in the station during a MATCH.**  The CAPTAIN and the DRIVERS must stay in their DRIVER STATION and the HUMAN PLAYER must remain in the human player station they are in when the MATCH begins. Small and inconsequential violations will receive a verbal warning.

 

**【G05】 No outside communication with the DRIVE TEAMS during a MATCH.**  Members of the DRIVE TEAM are expected to only communicate with other DRIVE TEAM members in their MATCH.

 

Communication with spotters in the stands or via any wireless communication means is not allowed. This rule is not intended to apply to general cheering and support--only strategic coordinated coaching communication from anyone outside of the DRIVE TEAM.

 

**【G06】 DRIVE TEAM members should not contact anything inside of the PLAYING FIELD until the LED lights indicate that it is safe to do so.** Team members should not reach into the PLAYING FIELD and contact the field surface, field structures, any game elements, or ROBOTS, either directly or transitively through an object, unless the LEDs on the field are Green to indicate that the PLAYING FIELD is safe to enter. This rule applies both before and after the MATCH, and in all situations except those covered by **G12** and **E11.**

 

**【G07】 ROBOTS should stay in one piece on the field.** ROBOTS may not intentionally detach parts on the field during a MATCH.  Minor violations which do not affect the outcome of the match will result in a verbal warning.

 

**【G08】 Don’t intentionally damage, tip over, or disable other ROBOTS.** Strategies which are aimed at damaging, tipping or disabling other robots are not in the spirit of *FIRST* Global and are not allowed. Teams are responsible for the actions of their robots at all times. Driving recklessly is not an excuse for tipping or damaging another robot. Teams are also responsible for building a robust robot which will not easily tip or become entangled due to minor contact.

 

Accidental tipping and entanglement may occur and is part of normal game play, however intentional or egregious violations as determined by the Head Referee may result in disqualification.  Repeat offenses may result in a team being disqualified from the rest of the event.

 

**【G09】 ROBOTS should be designed to permit easy removal of game elements without requiring the robot to be powered.**

 

**【G10】 Scores will be calculated when everything comes to rest at the end of the MATCH.**

 

**【G11】 ROBOTs must function in imperfect situations.** The field and placement of items within the PLAYING FIELD may vary by up to +/- 25mm except if specifically noted in the field build guide. ROBOT designs should be robust enough to work effectively even if the field or game elements are not perfectly sized or have a slightly different texture or color.

 

**【G12】** **After the MATCH has started, if a team’s robot has not moved, DRIVE TEAM members may handle their own robot.**  DRIVE TEAM members and specifically designated *FIRST* Global Field Support can try the following corrections to attempt to get their ROBOT playing in the current MATCH.

1. Turn the robot on or off
2. Plug in the battery
3. Fix loose wire connections

Once the robot has moved under its own power, the robot may not be touched by any humans until the MATCH has ended. Teams should be careful that they do not touch other mobile ROBOTS or any part of the PLAYING FIELD while attempting repair on their immobile robot, as that contact would be considered a violation of **E05** and/or **G06**.

*Violation Consequence: ROBOT Disabled for MATCH*   

 

**【G13】** **Strategies aimed at causing an opponent to violate a rule are not allowed.** If an alliance forces an opponent to violate a rule, the penalty that would typically be assigned to the opponent will instead be assigned to the alliance that forced the violation.

 

**【G14】 ROBOTS may not grab, grapple, or grasp field elements unless otherwise explicitly permitted.**  Robot mechanisms should not be designed to react against multiple sides of a field element. This rule excludes game objects (e.g. FUEL CUBES, POWER LINE CUBES, and SOLAR PANELS).

 

This rule is intended to prevent teams from damaging the field, either intentionally or unintentionally.

 

**【G15】 Scores are final and there are no replays.** All of the volunteers at *FIRST* Global work hard to provide fair and consistent game experience for all teams, but they are human and may make mistakes. How teams deal with adversity will say as much about their character as how they deal with success. Teams should avoid situations which could be rules violations and make their scoring actions very clear to avoid misunderstandings.

 

If teams have questions about rules or rulings, there will be a designated area near the field where the DRIVE TEAM can wait for the Head Referee or Technical Advisor and discuss the concern.

 

**【G16】 Behave as if you are representing your whole nation on a global stage.** All teams are expected to behave in a respectful and professional manner when interacting with other *FIRST* Global teams and Staff during the *FIRST* Global event. STUDENTS and adults are held to the same standard, and teams may be disqualified from the *FIRST* Global competition for uncivil or egregious behavior from any party affiliated with the team. 

 

When at the *FIRST* Global Competition, be aware of your host country’s culture and rules for adults and youth. *FIRST* Global is a truly international competition and so the cultural customs and expectations of other teams may not be the same as your home country. Everyone should be aware of this fact and approach interactions with good intent and positive expectations.

## Game Specific Rules

 

**【E01】 Robots must start each match touching the GUARDRAIL closest to their DRIVE TEAM.**  Some part of the robot must be in contact with the GUARDRAIL. No other part of the robot may be in contact with any other field element (with the exception of the team’s one (1) FUEL CUBE allowed in **E02**) or any other ROBOT.

*Violation Consequence: The problem must be corrected before the match can start.*

 

**【E02】 Robots may start the MATCH preloaded with one (1) FUEL CUBE.**  Before the match starts, each team is allowed to place one (1) FUEL CUBE in, on, or in contact with their ROBOT. These FUEL CUBES will come from the central FUEL CUBE starting zone. If a team chooses not to preload a cube, the cube will remain in the starting area.

*Violation Consequence: The problem must be corrected before the match can start.*

 

**【E03】 Damaged Game objects no longer score.** POWER LINE CUBES, FUEL CUBES, or SOLAR PANELS which have broken open or are significantly deformed will no longer be able to be SCORED.

 

**【E04】 Game objects should stay on the PLAYING FIELD.** Game objects should stay on the PLAYING FIELD or be scored in designated goals. Items accidentally ejected from the PLAYING FIELD will be reintroduced at the approximate location they exited when safe to do so. Intentional ejection of game pieces from the PLAYING FIELD will result in a verbal warning.

 

**【E05】 HUMAN PLAYERS must not directly interact with ROBOTS during the MATCH.**  HUMAN PLAYER(S) are never allowed to touch ROBOTS, either directly or transitively through an object, even if a portion of the ROBOT is outside of the GUARDRAIL, with the exception of **G12**.

*Violation Consequence: ROBOT Disabled for MATCH* 

 

**【E06】 ROBOTS cannot CONTROL all of the Cubes.** ROBOTS are limited to CONTROLLING up to three (3) cubes at any one time, either FUEL CUBES and/or POWER LINE CUBES. Teams should also see **E07** when interacting with POWER LINE CUBES.

 

**【E07】 POWER LINE CUBES have restrictions.**  ROBOTS and HUMAN PLAYERS can only interact with POWER LINE CUBES that are the same color as their VILLAGE alliance. Each ROBOT is allowed to CONTROL no more than one (1) POWER LINE CUBE of their alliance’s color at a time.

 

**【E08】 SOLAR PANELS have restrictions.**  ROBOTS and HUMAN PLAYERS can only interact with SOLAR PANELS that are the same color as their VILLAGE alliance. Each ROBOT is allowed to control no more than one (1) SOLAR PANEL of their alliance’s color at a time.

 

**【E09】 Energy Impact is intended to be a scoring game.**  ROBOT actions, intentional or not, which are only intended to prevent the other team from scoring or which are outside the intent of fair and productive game play are not allowed. These actions include but are not limited to:

1. Interfering with a FUEL CUBE scoring in the opposing alliance’s side of the field.
2. Interfering with a POWER LINE CUBE scoring in the opposing alliance’s VILLAGE POWER STATION
3. Blocking access to the opposing alliance’s scoring areas
4. Preventing the free movement of one or more of the opposing alliance’s robots by blockading, trapping or pinning.

 

**【E10】 Start and Stop your ROBOT at the right time.** ROBOTS should start the match stationary and in compliance with the starting rules in **E01**. Controllers can be held by the DRIVE TEAM with the robot program in the *Init* state, but the robots cannot move until “GO” in the countdown "3, 2, 1, GO!". Robots should stop moving promptly when the timer reaches zero (0:00) seconds remaining in the match, and the robot program should be stopped as soon as possible afterwards.

 

**【E11】 Be very careful when interacting with the LOADING ZONE.** HUMAN PLAYERS can carefully introduce SOLAR PANELS and/or POWER LINE CUBES into the LOADING ZONE only when there are no ROBOTS or parts of ROBOTS located within or above the LOADING ZONE.

 

HUMAN PLAYERS should be aware of **E05**, and must be very careful that their actions in the LOADING ZONE do not also violate that rule.

# **The Tournament**

## **Ranking Matches**

Each team will play a number of matches based on the time allowed in the schedule. Match assignments will be generated as soon as possible once ROBOTS have been Inspected. Teams will earn ranking points based on their alliance’s performance during Ranking Matches, and the ranking points will determine which teams advance to the final rounds of play.

 

The exact Ranking Match schedule will be released later closer to the event.

## **Rankings**

Teams receive ranking points based on the following:

1. Winning Teams of a Ranking Match each receive two (2) ranking points.
2. Losing Teams of a Ranking Match each receive zero (0) ranking points.
3. If a Ranking Match ends in a tie, all four teams receive one (1) ranking point.
4. If a Team is disqualified, that team receives zero (0) ranking points.

 

If ranking points are tied, the next factor used for determining which teams advance to the final rounds of play will be the total score from all of the team’s previous matches, with the highest total score(s) advancing.

 

If ranking points and the highest total score from all previous matches are both tied, the next factor used for determining which team(s) advance to the final rounds of play will be total Coopertition Points, with the highest total Coopertition Point(s) advancing.

## **Tournament Advancement**

At the end of the first round of Scored Matches, teams are ranked and the top 24 (or 36) teams play additional rounds of matches with random alliance partners assigned in the same way as the qualification matches.

 

The ranking of these final rounds of play will be based on the total individual score (not ranking points). The highest total individual score will win the tournament.

 

If the highest total score is tied, the next factor used for determining the winner of the tournament will be total Coopertition Points, with the highest total Coopertition Point(s) ranked at the top of the tournament.

 

If total score and highest total Coopertition Point(s) are both tied, the next factor used for determining the winner of the tournament will be total Parking Points, with the highest total Parking Point(s) ranked at the top of the tournament.

## **Tournament Rules**

**【T01】 The only team members allowed in the competition field area are the DRIVE TEAM wearing their identifying buttons.**  See **G03.**

 

**【T02】 Teams are expected to show up on time to their scheduled matches.** If a team’s ROBOT is broken, they should send at least one (1) HUMAN PLAYER to the match while the rest of the team is working on repairing their robot. Matches will not be delayed to wait for a missing team. Match schedules are subject to change and can be running ahead or behind the listed times. Teams are expected to actively monitor which matches are currently playing to ensure they arrive to their scheduled matches on time.

*Violation Consequence: Automatic RED CARD for the team that did not show up to the MATCH*

 

**【T03】 Show up at the field ready to play.**   DRIVE TEAMS should show up to the field with all their equipment in a condition that is ready to play. Matches are expected to start promptly. Teams are not permitted to make repairs or perform complicated set-up or adjustments on the field.

 

**【T04】 Safety Glasses are required.** Properly rated safety glasses or side shields are required in the field area and should be worn always when working around the ROBOT.

 

**【T05】 Robots must display their Alliance and Country Flags.** At all times during the tournament, teams should display their country flag, which will be provided at inspection. During matches, teams must display the correct alliance color flag, which will be distributed in the queue and should be returned to the queueing station following the match.  Flags should be installed on the robot such that the entire flag is above the top of the robot at the beginning of the match.

# **The Robot**

## **Overview**

This section outlines the rules and requirements for the design and construction of your robot. *FIRST* Global robots are teleoperated and designed and built by students from designated national teams specifically to compete in the *Energy Impact* competition.  Before competing at *Energy Impact,* all robots will have to pass an inspection. 

## **Robot Rules**

**【R01】 Each ROBOT must pass an initial inspection before being allowed to play in any Qualification or Finals Matches.** 

1. If a Head Referee or Inspector determines that a robot is in violation of these rules, the team may be disqualified from the current match if they are playing and will be required to pass a re-inspection before competing in their next match.
2. Teams may be asked for a spot re-inspection at any time.
3. If a team makes major modifications to their robot, re-inspection will be required.

 

**【R02】 ROBOTS must be constructed from only the quantity and type of components included in their 2018 FIRST Global kit unless otherwise explicitly allowed.**  Each team will receive one (1) 2018 *FIRST* Global Kit as part of their registration. Teams may elect to buy more parts to experiment with or as spares, but extra components cannot be used to increase the quantity available to include on the final robot.

 

Additional parts may be purchased directly from[ ](http://www.revrobotics.com)[www.revrobotics.com](http://www.revrobotics.com) or by emailing sales@revrobotics.com. A bill of materials is included with each *FIRST* Global Kit shipped. Additional copies of the bill of materials can be found at[ ](http://www.revrobotics.com/first-global/)[www.revrobotics.com/first-global/](http://www.revrobotics.com/first-global/).

 

**【R03】 Official REV Robotics Products only.** Unless otherwise specified in **R04**, no substitutions are allowed. This rule is intended to keep the playing field equal for all teams. 

 

**【R04】 ROBOTS are allowed the following additional “Non-REV” Parts:**  

1. Any commercially available M3 screws up to 50mm long and any commercially available nuts and/or washers to fit.

2. Additional zip ties or cable ties. Must be functionally equivalent in all ways (e.g. not longer, not stronger nor stiffer). 

3. Non-aerosol grease used in extreme moderation only on the internal gearing of motors, or servos as needed after a gearing repair. Grease should never be able to come in contact with the playing surface, field elements, or game objects.

4. Small amounts of tape or heat-shrink tubing used solely for:

5. 1. Labeling wires, motors, or sensors
   2. Securing any wired connections

 

**【R05】 Not all parts may be modified.**  Modifying motors or servos in any way is not allowed. Modifications to wires which are to be used with Electronic Components are not allowed, except when those modifications return the wires to their original condition as provided by REV. Modifications to any Electronic Components is not allowed. Cutting mechanical components such as extrusion, brackets, screws, chain, hook and loop, cords, etc. is allowed.

 

Teams are encouraged to cut and customize parts in their kits as allowed to make the best robot design they can. Since teams only get limited materials in the kit, it is important to think before you cut!

 

**【R06】 Not all designs that meet all other rules are legal.** The following kinds of designs are not allowed:

1. Those which could potentially damage the field
2. Those which could potentially damage the game objects
3. Those which pose an unnecessary risk of entanglement

 

**【R07】 Robots may use only one control system.** This means one (1) Control Hub, one (1) Expansion Hub, and one (1) battery.
